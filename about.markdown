I am an aspiring Data Scientist with a diverse background in mathematics and physics. I hold a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics from St. Olaf College and a master's degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of Washington and research experience from Los Alamos National Laboratory. Besides my passion for math and physics, my other interests include jazz music, weightlifting, and tennis.
